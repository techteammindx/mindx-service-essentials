## Merge changes to master
- When being asked to merge to master, it means following through from local commit till the Pull request complete
- Never leave a PR without reading and address the PR reviews
- PR reviews are ready when Mergeable: true, and Mergeable State: clean
- Create todo list to cover the following steps:
	1. Bump version, clean, run checks (lint, format, type, test)
	2. Check out to new branch, commit then push the changes
	3. Create PR to master
	4. Wait at least 60 seconds, then check PR status and comments, if the PR checks are still running, wait for another 60 seconds and then check again
	5. If the PR checks are with critical issues to address (PR comments or CI build errors), then address them, push the change again, then wait 60 seconds then check again
	6. When PR are all checked, critical reviews and errors are addressed, merge it
	7. Check out to master, pull and stop

## Comit the rules and docs
- When add or commit, include `.cursor/rules/* `docs/**/*` `tasks/**/*` and `bugs/**/*` files, they are part of the features

## Commit messages
Do not write long commit description, keep them under 10 lines
**IMPORTANT** Do not use git reset

## Sub-modules
DO NOT commit, stage or add sub-modules, leave them there

## Tools
- Use 'github' mcp/tool to create PR, check PR status and PR reviews, instead of 'gh' (gh is not logged in)
- Use 'git' mcp/tool to operate git, instead of git terminal command
- Use direct shell `sleep` to wait or sleep
