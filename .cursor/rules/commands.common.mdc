## Commands
- Use `github` mcp/tool for checking github issues and PRs
- Use ado mcp/tool for checking azure devops build and release
- Use `desktop-commander` for file operations: read, write, edit, search files, search within file
- Use `filesystem` when `desktop-commander` fails
- Only when both `desktop-commander` and `filesystem` fail, use other methods
- Use `git` mcp/tool for local git operattion
- If `git` mcp/tool fails for missing working dir, run `git_set_working_dir`
- Use `ddg-search` for search/web-search
- Use `fetch` to fetch, get remote url
- Use `sequential-thinking` when brainstorming, planning or complex discussions

## Filesystem tool/mcp
- **DO NOT** use filesystem directory_tree to scan the whole folder, the content will be too much to process, use `list_directory` instead
- **Exclude** node_modules from filesystem search, unless that's the intention

## Wait or Sleep
- **DO NOT** use desktop commander to wait or sleep
- Use direct shell `sleep` to wait or sleep

## TS
- Prioritize `pnpm` over `npm` or `yarn`

## Notes
- MCP means Model Context Protocol
