## Key Folders and Files

This document provides a high-level overview of the mindx-atlas project structure for first-time readers.

### Project Structure

**mindx-atlas** is a unified repository designed as a navigation and AI context hub for API layers, services, apps, MCP endpoints, and agents. It follows a structured approach with an incubator area for new projects and graduated areas for mature components.

### Root Level

Currently, the project is in its initial setup phase with minimal structure:

- `.github/` - GitHub configuration and workflows
- `docs/ - Documentation and planning materials
- `tools/` - Top level tools, used to orchestrate and setup sub-modules

### Key Directories

#### `.github/workflows/`
Contains GitHub Actions workflows, including Claude AI integration

#### `docs/`
Documentation hub with organized subdirectories:
- **`docs/plans/`** - Contains project roadmaps and planning documents
- **`docs/notes/`** Contain notes after updates
- **`docs/investigations/`** Contain issues and bugs investigations
- **`docs/guides/`** Contain user and AI guide

### `tools/`
Top-level tools, used to orchestrate and setup sub-modules

### `apis/`
API Layer, usually expose and server GraphQL or Rest API for app or consumer

## `services/`
Micro-services, usually unexposed, business-domain-specfic services for API layer to call. Micro-services do not directly call each other

## `mcps/`
Thin MCP (Model Context Protocol) services, helping AI model interact with the system 

## `agents/`
AI agents, background or on-request

### Important Files
