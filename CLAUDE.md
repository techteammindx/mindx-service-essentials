# Educational Intent (No Production Guidance)
- These guidelines exist strictly for training exercises; every stack and transport choice is selected to aid learner comprehension.
- Discussions, research, and implementations must avoid production, scaling, ops, or enterprise-grade assumptions unless explicitly assigned.

# Scope
- Govern edits across `mindx-service-essentials` when training new hires.
- Preserve the educational service skeleton; expose business logic plainly.
- Apply when adjusting tooling, specs, or docs that support the core exercises.

# Core Commands
- `context7` — primary research interface; invoke via MCP before falling back to web searches.

# Key Files & Responsibilities
- `README.md` — keep project brief aligned with training goals.
- `.env.compose` — maintain baseline env vars; never introduce real secrets.
- `docker/` — keep compose setups minimal and reproducible for walkthroughs.
- `scripts/` — preserve direct CLI wrappers; avoid extra orchestration layers.
- `docs/` — respect date-based structure; update only the targeted session folder.
- `specs/` — follow scoped specs; sync behavior changes back into bullets.

# Interfaces & Dependencies
- Local Docker services defined in `.env.compose` and `docker/`; ensure names stay consistent with docs.
- Shell tooling under `scripts/`; keep arguments stable so walkthroughs remain valid.
- Parent `mindx-atlas` context; avoid assumptions about external services beyond provided mocks.

# Implementation Rules
- Prefer flat modules and explicit naming; do not abstract unless duplication is painful.
- Enforce KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): keep control flow shallow, limit helpers to single-purpose functions, avoid patterns new hires cannot trace in one pass.
- Surface full request/response flows even if mocked; optimize for readability over reuse.
- Document any learner-facing change inside the relevant dated doc folder only when assigned.
- Keep dependencies to those already present; justify any addition as essential for comprehension.
- When researching frameworks or infrastructure, prioritize Context7 MCP resources before turning to web searches.
- Maintain deterministic defaults in configs so fresh clones run without extra setup.
- Keep Docker setups ephemeral by avoiding external host volume mounts; rely on container-local storage for exercises.
- Use `pnpm` for all JavaScript package management and script execution; avoid mixing npm or Yarn commands.

# Architecture
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** — Model the codebase around the domain language. Isolate domain logic in explicit domain modules, keep application services thin, and ensure training exercises expose how domain concepts map to code.
- **Hexagonal Architecture** — Structure the core domain at the center, surrounded by ports (interfaces defining contracts) and adapters (implementations for specific technologies). Keep business logic independent of external frameworks, expose adapter-to-domain boundaries clearly, and ensure learners see how dependencies flow inward toward the domain.

# Do Not Touch Unless Explicitly Instructed By User
- `.claude/` — system-managed agent state; editing breaks automation history.
- `.factory/` — tooling artifacts regenerated by automation.
- `docs/brainstorm/**` entries outside the active date — reserved for other sessions.
